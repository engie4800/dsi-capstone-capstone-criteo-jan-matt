- precision, recall, f1, accuracy - compare for metrics + banner vs banner only
- use the train and test dataset the martin gave

on test data!!

idea: majority voting ensemble method, as each method gives different FP/FN


in pca, points that are close together, we should examine the heatmaps. look at certain thresholds. 1000 clicks -> method accurate, otherwise not accurate

can we augment the data? diff methods at diff thresholds?
