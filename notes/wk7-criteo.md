# discussion with professor
- jan's question: is project more research based or implementation based? no fixed rule
- jan -> we want something that works for a fixed use case, specific banners have a certain heatmap, get something agnostic to the number of products in the banner, and can identify the problem for a low number of clicks


# what jan wants
- heatmap data and other metrics for grid type 
- determine which metric data is needed for heatmap data
- expand training data to more grids
- test dataset that compromises different grid IDs
- each new grid - training data
- one grid ID can have a varying number of products, it is a general layout, how they are positioned within the 2D space
- get more data for other grid IDs
