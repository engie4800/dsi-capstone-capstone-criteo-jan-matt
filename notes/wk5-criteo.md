# Progress update
- Ling: Isolation forest and ground truth labels
- Martin: Starter_code and ground truth labels
- Jenny/Xinyi: first ideas for metrics dataset?
- Jean: PCA (with explained variance %) or PCA + **explained variance**, PCA to 10 / knn / k means?


# To add to the ppt slides
- Ground truth labels (Martin)
- Isolation forest results (Ling)
- PCA/ KNN / (Jean) + ground truth
- First ideas for metrics (Jenny/Xinyi)

# Questions to ask
- the dataset "metric" and "heatmap" were collected over different periods of time, the banners might not be broken at different time periods? 
  - try to see if it's possible for the metrics data and heatmap data to be over the same time period


# To think
- definition of broken banner: human behavior, if we have >=3 clusters is that a broken banner? domain knowledge! 
    - both metrics dataset and
